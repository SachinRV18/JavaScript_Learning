# Description : This contains the notes of JS 

 <!-- - Part : 1 -->
alert("Hello") # added a alert msg
<script src="index.js"></script> # to link an external java script file
we can also run the code from the browser console :
right click on browser >> select inspect >> then console >> "act like a text editor"
we can comment the code using two slashes (//) in JS.
console.log("data") : whatever the data we enter inside the console.log it will displayed in the console of the browser.

 <!-- - Part : 2 -->
 variables : we can declare a variable using (var, let and const)
 var keyword is depricated in ES6, so in modern JS we are not using anymore.
 ES6 : means ECMAScript 6 or ES2015
 JS always follow top down approch
 var greeting;  // conditionally rendering some data
 <!-- Rules and Convention of Variables -->
1. Variables is starts with letters or _  or $.
camelcase : example - firstName
Pascalcase : example - FirstName
var and let are same.
If we use const we cannot reassign its values, it will throw an error.
Note: we cannot change the value of the constant variable, but we can change the "value of the object" of constant variable

 <!-- - Part : 3 -->
 Datatypes in JS
 
 1. Primitive Datatypes
 stored directly in the location the variable access
 stored in stack
 string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol

 2. Reference Datatypes 
 accessed by reference (key)
 stored in heap, and points to location in memory
 arrays, object Literals, Functions

 "typeof" function used in JS to know the data type of the variable

  <!-- - Part : 4 -->
  <!-- Type convention -->
conversion of one data type into another
console.log(val.length) : it will work only for strings it will print total number of characters in the string.
It is a property of a string


we can convert also using toString() method
val.toFixed(2) the toFixed used to define how many decimals we want example 2.00

parseInt() this method used to convert into number from any data type
